# Reading Machine

This project explroes new ways to read Gertrude Stein's "unreadable masterpiece" The Making of Americans.

## How to deploy

You can download the three files to a local directory, and open index.html in a browser. Some notes:
- The index.html file needs internet access to load in the D3 library
- The index.html file contains the full text (public domain) to the book; the link to the poetry.js file comes at the end.
